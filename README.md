# Group-Theory

This is a Phaser port of the popular card game Set. Each card has a number of properties:

Shape - either circle, square, or cross
Number - one, two, or three shapes
Color - red, green, or blue
Filling - either solid, clear, or grey

A group is a set of three cards, where each property is either identical, or different amongst all three cards. Two cards with an identical
property, and one different card, does not a group make. 

Feel free to fork and modify at your whim.
